"description": "Two bedroom suite with a queen and two full-sized beds. Mini-kitchenette and fridge. Laundry. Perfect for group or family. Close to DC Metro. Free parking. Separate entrance and private bath - private and secure - can come and go as you please!\n\nWelcome to the Ridge Road Guesthouse, a single-family home in a quite neighborhood, divided into two separate 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartments.  \n\nThe Guesthouse is a single-family home from the 1940's, in a quiet neighborhood about 7 miles or 15 minutes drive from DC.  Easy access to 395, the Pentagon, Crystal City, Old Town Alexandria, and downtown DC.  \n\nThe 2 bedroom suite consists one room above the garage with a queen sized bed, and a second bedroom down the stairs in a finished basement room, which has 2 full-sized beds.  There is also your own private bathroom, and a kitchenette with a refrigerator, microwave, large toaster oven, coffee maker, hot plate, pots, pans, and dishes and utensils for making a simple home-cooked meal, or re-heating leftovers from one of the great restaurants in the neighborhood.\n\nEach of the two apartments is completely private, with no shared space, except the laundry and backyard patio and bar-b-que.  You enter and exit separately, and have your own room and bathroom.\n\nThe bedroom above the garage is sunny, suite contains a room and bathroom, with plenty of closet space.  There is an iron and ironing board, and a mini-kitchenette, including  a refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster oven and microwave.  There is also a freezer in the garage, if you need additional storage space, or if you would like ice.  There is access to laundry in the garage as well. \n\nThe second bedroom is a large finished room down the stairs in the basement. It has two full-sized beds, a couch, and a small dining table with four chairs.  It also has a mini-kitchenette with a small refrigerator.\n\nThe suite is perfect for a family or group traveling together.  There is plenty of space, and all the amenities you will need for your visit to the Washington area!\n\nGuests will have access to laundry facilities, and high-speed wi-fi internet.  The wi-fi is fast enough to download and watch your favorite shows in the evening.  When it's warm out, I encourage you to check out the backyard garden with a grill.  \n\nThe room is also equipped with a TV and a Roku 3 internet streaming player.  You can get local TV as well as on-demand Netflix, Hulu, hundreds of movies and TV shows, as well as games and music.\n\nI live just down the road, and my team, Juanita and Antonio and I are around the house regularly helping guests, and making sure everything is comfortable during your stay.  When you book, I give you a key-code for the garage, as well as a key to the suite, so you can check-in and come and go anytime without worrying about bothering anyone, or interrupting.  As I said, I live a couple blocks away, and regularly come by to visit guests, to show them around, and orient them to the neighborhood and sites in Washington, DC.  Please call me anytime, and I'm happy to help!\n\nI live in the Braddock Heights neighborhood, which is halfway between Shirlington and Del Ray. It is a quiet, safe neighborhood, with easy parking for drivers, and access to dozens of public transportation options. While you are here, check out the Shirlington area for a huge variety of dining options, as well as movies and a theater. Also check out the Del Ray area, with several nice restaraunts and shops. We are also close to Old Town Alexandria, which has tons of shopping, dining and entertainment options to fill your evenings.\n\nIf you are driving, there is free street parking with no restrictions right on front of the house, as well as parking in the driveway available at a first-come-first serve basis.  If the driveway is free, feel free to park there!\n\nIf you take the metro, get off at the Braddock Road stop (Yellow/Blue line, 1st stop after National Airport.)\n\nFrom there, you can take a DASH Bus -- The AT-4 Northbound, which goes towards the Pentagon. It runs about every 20 minutes during peak hours. During the middle of the day, it runs less often, and is the AT3/4 Northbound. The drivers are helpful, and can help you out. The bus stops 1 block from the house.\n\nAlternatively, there are almost always cabs at the Braddock road stop, and you can catch one to the house directly for less than $10. Or you can use Uber, if you prefer.\n\nOr you can walk the 1.7 miles (2.7 km) directly up Braddock road.

"description": "Classic Alexandria single family home with tons of space for you, your friends and family!  Grill out on the back patio, and make your business trip feel more like a vacation.  Easy, free parking, access to several public transportation options.\n\nWelcome to the Ridge Road Guesthouse, a single-family home in a quite neighborhood, divided into two separate 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartments. \n\nThe Guesthouse is a single-family home from the 1940's, in a quiet neighborhood about 7 miles or 15 minutes drive from DC.  Easy access to 395, the Pentagon, Crystal City, Old Town Alexandria, and downtown DC.  \n\nThe 2 bedroom main house apartment has hardwood floors, kitchen, dining room, living room and bathroom.  If you are traveling with a your family or a group of friends, there is plenty of space to accommodate you all.  There is a King-size bed in the master bedroom, and two full-sized beds in the 2nd bedroom.  \n\nEach of the two apartments is completely private, with no shared space, except the laundry and backyard patio and bar-b-que.  You enter and exit separately, and have your own room and bathroom.\n\nYou are also welcome to enjoy the backyard porch, patio and garden, including a gas grill.  This is the perfect alternative to a cramped, overpriced hotel room!  Spread out, and feel like you are at home while visiting DC!\n\nGuests in the main house will have have access to the kitchen, dining room, living room, back porch, and backyard garden with a grill.  Please note that the house is split into two independent units, each with their own private entrance and private bath.  (There is also two bedroom \"suite\", which consists of a bedroom above the garage, and a bedroom in the basement.)  The only shared space in the house is the laundry, which is in the garage, and the backyard patio and bar-b-que grill. \n\nI live just down the road, and my team, Juanita and Antonio and I are around the house regularly helping guests, and making sure everything is comfortable during your stay.  When you book, I give you a key-code for the garage, as well as a key to the suite, so you can check-in and come and go anytime without worrying about bothering anyone, or interrupting.  As I said, I live a couple blocks away, and regularly come by to visit guests, to show them around, and orient them to the neighborhood and sites in Washington, DC.  Please call me anytime, and I'm happy to help!\n\nI live in the Braddock Heights neighborhood, which is halfway between Shirlington and Del Ray.  It is a quiet, safe neighborhood, with easy parking for drivers, and access to dozens of public transportation options.  While you are here, check out the Shirlington area for a huge variety of dining options, as well as movies and a theater.  Also check out the Del Ray area, with several nice restaurants and shops.  We are also close to Old Town Alexandria, which has tons of shopping, dining and entertainment options to fill your evenings.\n\nIf you are driving, there is free street parking with no restrictions right on front of the house.\n\nIf you take the metro, get off at the Braddock Road stop (Yellow/Blue line, 1st stop after National Airport.)\n\nFrom there, you can take a DASH Bus -- The AT-4 Northbound, which goes towards the Pentagon. It runs about every 20 minutes during peak hours. During the middle of the day, it runs less often, and is the AT3/4 Northbound. The drivers are helpful, and can help you out.  The bus stops 1 block from the house.\n\nAlternatively, there are almost always cabs at the Braddock road stop, and you can catch one to the house directly for less than $10.  Or you can use Uber, if you prefer.\n\nOr you can walk the 1.7 miles (2.7 km) directly up Braddock road. It is an uphill walk, but through a nice, pleasent neighborhood.\n\nPlease note that the house is split into two independent units, each with their own private entrance and private bath.

An urban park like no other, it's got a huge cascading fountain and 12 acres of green trees and unique sculptures right in the middle of the city.  \n\nCentral Location.  Even better is you are central to 3 of the best areas in DC.  Walk one block east and you are right in the bustling U Street Corridor, a few blocks west and you are on 18th street in Adams Morgan. Go south a few blocks and you are right at Dupont Circle.  Walk north and you are in Columbia Heights.  I love this neighborhood because it is quiet and residential, but still close to all the action.  \n\nSafety.  This is one of the safest areas of DC.  Take caution as you would in any city.  Most of NW is pretty safe but this area is a lot more established than some of the up and coming neighborhoods.\n\nEvery form of transportation is an option.\n\nParking?  There is only street parking available, but it is FREE.  A rarity in DC (or any city), the street next to the apartment is unmetered and there are always spots available on W street (between 15th and 16th).  You will even be able to see your car from the window of the unit. The only restriction is a street cleaning on Monday mornings meaning you would have to move it out of the space for about 1/2 hour.  \n\nRental Car?  There are 2 on-site Enterprise vehicles in the building's parking lot available to rent.  Simply contact Enterprise and they will set it up for you, you can pick up a car from right in front of the building and drop it off in the same spot when you are done.  There are also two Zipcar spaces with a similar set up.\n\nBikeshare?  Super easy.  There are 3 pickup locations within a block of the building.  You can rent a bike for $7/day or get a 3 day pass for $15.\n\nMetro?  The Green and Yellow lines are a 3 block walk from the unit.  There are Smart Cards in the apartment for you to use, simply take the card with you when you head out for the day and you can charge it at any metro station using a debit card, credit card or cash.\n\nBus?  There is a bus stop less than a block away and 4 different bus lines are available for pick up every 7-10 minutes. You can get straight downtown to the National Mall in about 10-15 minutes.\n\nThere are maps of the city and transit information in the apartment.  \n\nI am friendly, laid back and accommodating.  My guests are always happy with my recommendations so definitely don't hesitate to ask.  I know the city well.  I am well-organized and always available for questions.  \n\nThanks for looking :)\n\nRecently renovated apartment overlooks the cascading fountains of Meridian Park. The studio is large and centrally located. One block to the U Street Corridor and three blocks to Adams Morgan and Dupont Circle.  White House is a quick 15 minute walk.\n\nHouseRules:\nPlease just be respectful and leave the place how you found it.",
